Several points to pay attention when you are checking our project:

1. The required two documentation files are in the doc directory: 
(1) designDiscussion.md
(2) documentation.md

2. The test pictures and pcap files have the naming format of test*.png/pcap
Also, the test6.png and test6.pcap file are our final milestone in this project.

3. We add the logger(in the macrologger.h) part to debug.

4. Our MSS is set to be 1375, which is the same as the data packet max length.
